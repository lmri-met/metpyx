        """
        Merge two pandas DataFrames representing measurement data.

        This method merges two DataFrames representing measurement data, typically for different magnitudes,
        into a single DataFrame. It then reorders the index of the merged DataFrame to follow a specific pattern
        for readability and consistency.

        Parameters
        ----------
        df1 : pandas.DataFrame
            The first DataFrame containing measurement data.
        df2 : pandas.DataFrame
            The second DataFrame containing measurement data.

        Returns
        -------
        pandas.DataFrame
            Merged DataFrame with the index reordered for consistency.

        Notes
        -----
        This method is particularly useful for combining measurement data from different sources or measurements
        of different magnitudes into a single coherent DataFrame for analysis and visualization.
